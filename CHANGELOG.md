Material Base v2 development changes
====================================

14.11.2022 - 2.0
----------------

* Changed template for textarea fields because of accessibility reasons. In case of any issues, see `themes/material_base_mdc/templates/form/form-element--textarea.html.twig` for reverting options.
* Moved subthemes to `themes` folder for proper Twig template discovery work.
* [#3316638](https://www.drupal.org/project/material_base/issues/3316638) Fixed password field issues.
* [#3316643](https://www.drupal.org/project/material_base/issues/3316643) Improved support of layout builder.
* [#3316641](https://www.drupal.org/project/material_base/issues/3316641) Changed base theme from "Stable" to "Stable 9" (using own copy made from Drupal code 9.4.8).

06.08.2022 - 2.0-beta5
----------------------

* Updated MDC library from 7.0.0 to 14.0.0.
  Important change: MDC list implementation is in transition state to the new implementation and all usage of `mdc-list` (including `mdc-list-item` and `mdc-list-item-*`) should be replaced by `mdc-deprecated-list`.
* Updated Webpack from 4.x to 5.x.
  Update of `webpack.config.js`, `package.json`, `package-json.lock` and `yarn.lock` is required.
* Fixed uploadable fields, file and image.
  The fix requires changes from [#2752443](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2752443), for more details see [#3170746](https://www.drupal.org/project/material_base/issues/3170746)
