Material Base v2
================

Introduction
------------

Material Base — is a base theme for Drupal 7, 8, 9 and 10.
It implements [Material Design](https://material.io/) concept by Google.

The theme was made as basic styles and a set of components, which can be easily combined for making beautiful Drupal themes instead of building them from scratch. It utilises [Material Components for web](https://m2.material.io/develop/web) library by Google.

Material Base v2 has been completely rewritten since version 1.x and there is no upgrade path from v1 to v2.

Material Base — is the theme for themers. It requires knowledge of Drupal theming system and CSS/SASS.

Happy theming!

Quick install
-------------

**Install theme**

The recommended way for getting the theme is installing it with Composer.

~~~
composer require 'drupal/material_base:^2.0'
~~~

For more information see this [page](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/using-composer/using-composer-to-install-drupal-and-manage-dependencies).

**Enable theme**

It is not recommended to use Material Base theme as a site theme, the best practice is to create a subtheme and specify Material Base as a base theme. However, base theme could be used for demonstration purposes.

Just enable it and make it default via Appearance settings or Drush, as usual.

Upgrate from 2.x-beta to 2.0 version
------------------------------------

In 2.x beta versions, Material Base used "Stable" as a base theme but in 2.0 it was changed to "Stable 9". The copy of "Stable 9" from Drupal Core 9.4.8 was added to Material Base as "Material Stable 9". Following the new approach of subtheming, Material Base using own copy of the base theme instead of referring to it.
Switching from "Stable" to "Stable 9" shouldn't make big difference but in case of regression issues, it will be the first place to check. Don't forget to run the update script after the update.

In 2.0 child themes were moved to the `themes` folder, to make the template discovery work correctly. If you created a subtheme based on the `material_base_subtheme` template, most likely you will need to update the path for `material_base_mdc/mdc` library files in `YOURTHEME.info.yml`, from `../dist/` to `../../dist/`.

**Before:**

```
libraries-override:
  material_base_mdc/mdc:
    css:
      theme:
        ../dist/css/mdc.css: false
```

**After:**

```
libraries-override:
  material_base_mdc/mdc:
    css:
      theme:
        ../../dist/css/mdc.css: false
```

In 2.0 default template for the Textarea field was changed. Alternative version with no floating label used by default due to compatibility with CKEditor. Original MDC implementation still available, see `themes/material_base_mdc/templates/form/form-element--textarea.html.twig` for reverting options.
