Variables
=========

Material Base provides Sass variables for site level customizations and options.

Defined variables and their default values stored in `sass\base\variables.scss`.

Main colors and typography variables reflects [MDC library](/mdc.md) variables structure. 

Layouts and styles of Material Base theme components are built depending on variables values. 

Adjusting variables
-------------------

Variables cover most of the coloring, default sizing, and typography definitions, so adjusting their values in your custom theme would be a good starting point for theme development.

Variables could be changed or added in your custom theme `sass\theme\variables.scss` file. Material Base theme components in your custom theme will be built depending on adjusted values.
